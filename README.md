# OpticFaux
CS289 | Spring 2015 - Final Project attempting to use a Genetic Algorithm to find new and unexpected camouflage from optic flow sensors. Much like a virtual cattle guard, it is my hypothesis that static patterns can be generated to fool optic flow into thinking the exact opposite of the real motion is happening. Both the wagon wheel effect as well as Moire patterns are examples of visual exploits to the human eye, one an issue of "framerate" or scanning and the latter of "resolution." In this project, we will start by trying to fool an artificial eye, with hopes of then fooling other simple eyes.
